    <span class="body1">Sick of sleeping,
        Searching for a cure.
        Lying awake
        Is a chore.
        Tossing and turning,
        Wrapped up tight.
        Getting out the duvet
        Is a fight.
        Insomnia's presence -
        Deep and dark,
        At the same time,
        Depression is stark.
        Candle burning
        At both ends.
        Struggling to speak
        With family and friends.
        If I don't start
        Opening up to talk,
        I will take
        My final walk.</span>
